    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Ryan's homemade maple cinnamon granola recipe is a very simple yet satisfying take on the classic snack. Utilizing only organic maple syrup as a sweetener, it is one of the cleaner recipes out there. With olive oil, salt, and cinnamon it provides a semi-sweet semi-savory flavor that is perfect for accompanying fruit.</p>
