    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Red lentil sauce is a vegetarian-friendly take on a traditional stuffed pepper sauce that brings all of the savory and umami goodness one would expect.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup dried lentils</li>
      <li>1 jar of Rao's marinara sauce</li>
      <li>3-4 green bell peppers</li>
      <li>1 small can of tomato paste</li>
      <li>Salt, pepper, garlic powder to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Place lentils in a small pot, fill with water to just above the level of the lentils. Bring to a boil, then simmer until most of the water has been absorbed.</li>
      <li>While the lentils are cooking, chop peppers into narrow strips or other preferred shape. Add to a large pot with olive oil and sautee until slightly softened.</li>
      <li>Reduce heat on large pot, then add sauce, tomato paste, and spices to the peppers. When lentils are ready, add them as well.</li>
      <li>Cook on low heat for ~30 minutes, stirring regularly.</li>
      <li>Bake some spaghetti squash or boil some pasta and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
